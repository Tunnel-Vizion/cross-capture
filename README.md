# Cross Capture (cross-capture)
Cross Capture (cc for short) is a lightweight cross-platform screen capture library and utility. It is designed to be a pure implementation of screen capture capability using native libraries wherever possible.

# Motivations

It comes in response to a lack of open-source and decoupled screen capturing libraries. Most existing full-featured screen capture libraries are tied up in OBS and WebRTC, or are cumbersome like FFmpeg.

To follow the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle, this library **only** implements screen capturing capabilities and exposes an API.
